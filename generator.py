    Generate a grounded answer from retrieved rule chunks.

      - "text"     : the chunk text
      - "game"     : the game name
      - "distance" : similarity score (you can use this to filter weak matches)

      1. Answer using only the retrieved context — not the model's general knowledge
      2. Make clear which game the answer comes from
      3. Say so clearly when the answer isn't in the loaded rules

    Return the response as a plain string.
